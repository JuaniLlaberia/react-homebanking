## Home Banking Interface Project

The idea of this project was to built the front end of a "fake" bank by using react. By using dummy data stored in the client-side you can create accounts and use all the functionalities of the bank but without back-end (as a demo of how it would be).
You are able to: 
  1. Transfer money between bank clients,
  1. View movements history, sort them and see your balance,
  1. Create budgets to track your expenses,
  1. Watch the TOP 10 crypto currencies live,
  1. Change theme color
